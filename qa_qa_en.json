        "question": "What is microbiology and who studies it at SLU?",
        "answer": "Microbiology at SLU includes the science of microorganisms, which are usually independent, single-cell organisms such as bacteria, archaea, yeasts, microfungi, protozoa, single-cell algae, and viruses. Researchers at SLU study the impact of environmental factors on the structure of microbial societies in complex ecosystems, such as in soil, water, and the biogas process. They also explore the positive properties of microorganisms in food and feed, research microorganisms as pathogens on plants and animals, and use these as models for understanding important biological processes. Additionally, they study how to formulate and risk assess microorganisms that will be utilized for human purposes, such as pesticides, and conduct research on the capacity of bacteria to cause disease, on vaccine development, and on antibiotics."
